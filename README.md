# NSF proposal template
Ted Corcovilos, 2021

LaTeX template for National Science Foundation proposals submitted via Fastlane.

Best attempt was made to satisfy the formatting guidelines in the latest [Proposal & Award Policies & Procedures Guide (PAPPG) 22-1 (4 Oct. 2021)](https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/policydocs/pappg22_1/index.jsp).

In particular, page size, page margins, and line spacing are set correctly.  The default fonts for this template are Palatino Linotype 10pt for text and TeX Gyre Pagella Math for equations.  Other acceptable fonts are
* Arial 10pt
* Courier New 10pt
* Times New Roman 11pt
* Computer Modern 11pt
  
A BibLaTeX style file is included for the References.  Currently the References are appended to the end of the Project Description.  The user must manually split the resulting PDF file.

A suggested `.latexmkrc` file is included for use with `latexmk`.

Templates are included for the following parts of the proposal:
* Project Summary ("with special characters")
* Project Description
* Budget Justification
* Postdoc mentoring plan
* Data management plan
* Resources
* Biosketch
* List of suggested Reviewers
